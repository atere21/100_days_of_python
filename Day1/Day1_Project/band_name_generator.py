## Simple project demonstrating the concatenation of two strings, and taking input from user ##
##formatting purposes

print("\n")



# printing introduction + asking user for input. (end parameter is to not let print function jump to a new line and instead remain on the same line)

print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.\n")



#taking city input from user

city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? ")



#taking pet nanme from user

pet = input("\nWhat's your pet's name? ")



#concatenating city and pet names to produce a band name

print(f"\nYour band name could be {city + ' ' + pet}")
